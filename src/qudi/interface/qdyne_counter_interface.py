    """Interface class to define the controls for qdyne counting devices.

    A "qdyne counter" is a hardware device that counts events with a time stamp (timetagger, usually digital counter)
    or as a stream of data (timeseries, usually analog counter) during the acquisition period.
    The goal is generally to detect when events happen after a time defining trigger. For a timetagger each event is
    outputted individually with its respective time stamp after the trigger. The timeseries counter records the data
    during the whole acquisition interval.
    It can be used in two modes :
    - "Gated" : The counter is active during high (or low) trigger state.
    - "Ungated" : After a trigger the counter acquires one sweep for a given time and returns in its idle state
                  waiting for the next trigger.
