# Changelog

## Pre-Release

### Breaking Changes

  implementing this interface.
- Add back scan data and back scan settings getter and setter methods
  to `qudi.interface.scanning_probe_interface`.

- Major refactoring of scanning probe toolchain, including scanning probe logic, optimizer logic and gui modules.
  Implementation of configurable backward scans.

- Altered tektronix_awg70k hardware file to allow the use of the newer, B-series of Tektronix AWGs

### Other
- Remove the (non-functional) wavemeter dummy based on the already removed wavemeter interface.
- Removed `setup.py` and moved fully to `pyproject.toml` instead.
- Added some integration tests that run automatically via Github Actions on PRs and commits to main.

## Version 0.5.1

**âš  DEPRECATION WARNING**
This is the last release before major changes in the interfaces of the scanning probe toolchain (see PR #97).
No action is required if you're using our `ni_scanning_probe_interfuse` hardware. If you integrated new hardware
into the scanning probe toolchain, you will be required to adapt to the new interface beyond this version.


### Breaking Changes
- Major rework of `qudi.interface.data_instream_interface.DataInStreamInterface`. Time series
toolchain and NI x-series hardware module have been adapted but custom modules relying on this
interface will break.
Configuration for time series toolchain needs changes as well. See `default.cfg` or module
docstrings.

### Bugfixes
- Disconnect GUI widgets on deactivation of laser `LaserGui`
- Fix failure of saving plots in `QDPlotLogic` when fiting is used.
- Basic data saving in `TimeSeriesReaderLogic` works now.
- Fix missing meta info `generation_method_parameters` that occurred for generated sequences with granularity mismatch.
- Ni Finite Sampling Input module now returns digital input channel values in "clicks/counts" per second and not "clicks/counts" per clock cycle
- Fix wrong asset name, non-invokable settings for AWG Tek 70k in sequence mode.
- Fix disfunctional `mw_source_smbv`
- Fix Keysight AWG sample rate only set-able with too coarse 10 MHz precision
- Fix various Poimanager crashes

### New Features
- Added remote streamer support to `TimeSeriesReaderLogic`.
- New `qudi.interface.data_instream_interface.SampleTiming` Enum added to `DataInStreamInterface`
constraints to allow non-uniform sampling mode.
- Pulsed and odmr now add fit parameters to saved meta data.
- New hardware module added that implements the HighFinesse wavemeter as a data instream device, replacing the old (non-functional) wavemeter toolchain.
- Add option to save waveforms and sequence information for debugging to pulser dummy
- Introduce plugins to the pulsed toolchain that allow more control over `generation_parameters` and can influence all loaded `pulse_objects`.

### Other
- Bumped `qudi-core` package minimum version requirement to v1.5.0
- Got rid of deprecated `qudi.core.interface` module usage
- Support for Python 3.10
- This version 0.5.1 fixes a requirement issue found while pushing release 0.5.0 to test-pypi

## Version 0.4.0
### Breaking Changes
- `QDPlotLogic` has changed its public method signatures
- `OkFpgaPulser` now has a mandatory config option pointing towards a directory with the bitfiles necessary.

### Bugfixes
- Resolved some issues with QDPlot GUI layouts and improved overall QDPlot GUI code quality
- catching null bytes in Keysight M3202A module
- 2D gaussian fit arguments changed to be compatible with the datafitting toolchain.
### New Features
- First stable version of new scanning toolchain (aka omniscan):
    - New `blocking` argument for scanner moves executed via `ScanningProbeInterface`
    - Multiple bugfixes for the new scanning toolchain with NICard.
    - The NiScanningProbeInterfuse now polls data in chunks and independent of logic calls, as it should be.
    - More meta data of scans in saved data
- Support for Zaber (linear) motorized stages (in `qudi.hardware.motor.zaber_motion`)
- Overhaul of QDPlot toolchain (GUI and logic) to improve stability and consistency as well as
adding minor GUI features.
- Added mixin `qudi.interface.mixins.process_control_switch.ProcessControlSwitchMixin` to provide
optional default implementation satisfying the `SwitchInterface` for process control hardware
modules implementing any of the interfaces contained in `qudi.interface.process_control_interface`
- Overhaul of PID toolchain: added units support, normalization option, gui reset feature,
dependency option for `process_control_dummy` to simulate PID control
- support for Thorlabs power meters using the TLPM driver
- pulsed toolchain: generation parameters of sequence saved as meta data

### Other
- Bumped `qudi-core` package minimum version requirement to v1.2.0
